# Maternal Health Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an in-depth **Maternal Health Analysis** conducted using Power BI.  
The dashboard covers multiple aspects such as **demographics, lifestyle, nutrition, ultrasound findings, lab results, maternal fat levels during pregnancy, and delivery outcomes**.  

The analysis aims to provide valuable insights into maternal and newborn health patterns, highlight risk factors, and support better decision-making in healthcare.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores **maternal health datasets** and analyzes patient health outcomes through interactive Power BI dashboards.  

We focused on the following areas:  
- **Patient demographics & distribution**  
- **Lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol, drugs)**  
- **Nutrition and diet impact**  
- **Fat assessment & BMI correlations**  
- **Gestational diabetes and related conditions**  
- **Newborn health outcomes (APGAR score, birth weight, complications)**  
- **Delivery mode & complications**  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were to:  
- Analyze **maternal demographics** and hospitalization trends.  
- Study **lifestyle and nutrition patterns** influencing pregnancy outcomes.  
- Assess the impact of **BMI, fat distribution, and chronic diseases**.  
- Understand the relationship between **gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)** and delivery outcomes.  
- Evaluate **newborn health** through APGAR scores, weight, and complication metrics.  
- Provide actionable insights using **Power BI dashboards**.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

### 1. Patient Demographics
- Total patients: **272**  
- Average age: **26 years** (Min: 15, Max: 43)  
- **Hospital stay**: Majority stayed 1 day, only 9 patients stayed 3 days  
- **Ethnicity**: Majority White (141), followed by Black  
- **Delivery Mode**: Vaginal without episiotomy most common (128), C-section (59)  
- **BMI**: Most patients overweight/obese, 71 with normal weight  
- **Gestational Diabetes**: 51 patients  
- Other conditions: Hypertension (23), Chronic disease (52), Preeclampsia (15)  
- Trimester: Majority in **second trimester (62.89%)**  
- Newborn outcomes: 55 required immediate treatment; average weight **3.25 kg**

### 2. Lifestyle & Age Distribution
- Substance use: 47 alcohol users, 10 drug users, 53 smokers  
- Substance use highest in **20â€“29 age group**, declines with age  
- Younger patients (20â€“29) showed **highest MAP (54.15)**  
- Abnormal waist-hip ratio not strongly tied to gestational outcomes  


### 3. Diet Analysis
- Diet distribution: Mixed (48.9%), Healthy (43.75%), Unhealthy (7.35%)  
- **Hemoglobin**: Higher in patients with healthy diets (fruits/vegetables)  
- **BMI**: Mixed diets â†’ higher obesity; Healthy diets â†’ normal BMI  
- **Chronic Diseases**: Higher among high-calorie diet patients  
- **Pregnancy-related Diseases**: More prevalent in those on a healthy diet  

### 4. Maternal Health Conditions
- Most common conditions: **HIV (22.15%)**, Syphilis (21.26%), Hepatitis (20.64%), GDM (18.77%), Hypertension (17.17%)  
- Hypertension more common in **vaginal deliveries (58.38%)**  
- Cesarean reasons: Non-reassuring fetal status (16.83%), CPD (14.29%), Failed induction (10.20%)  

### 5. Fat Assessment
- Average preperitoneal fat: **26.98**, periumbilical fat: **62.67**  
- Higher fat linked to higher rates of **C-section due to CPD/NRFS**  
- 40% of women with high visceral fat also had GDM  
- Younger women (20â€“29) more prone to high visceral fat  
- Strong correlation between BMI before and during pregnancy  

### 6. Newborn Health Analysis
- **APGAR Score**: 85.45% good, ~8% critical  
- **Weight Distribution**: Normal (69.4%), Underweight (26.8%), Overweight (3.8%)  
- **Complications**: 17.5% airway aspiration, 17.3% meconium labor  
- Overweight newborns more common in obese mothers  
- C-sections linked to higher risk of airway and resuscitation needs  

### 7. Gestational Health & Diet Impact
- **Hematocrit & Hemoglobin**: More patients showed **low levels in 2nd & 3rd trimester**  
- **Diet & GDM**: High-calorie diets linked to higher GDM risk  
- **OGTT results**: Higher BMI â†’ higher chance of abnormal results  
- **Diet & Pregnancy Outcomes**: Healthy diet â†’ higher full-term births  

### 8. Miscarriage Analysis
- Total miscarriages: **49 cases**  
- Most common in **30â€“39 age group**  
- 15 miscarriages in tobacco users, 10 in alcohol users  
- GDM not strongly associated with miscarriages  
- Higher miscarriage risk in women over 35 with multiple pregnancies  

## âœ… Final Conclusion
- Maternal health outcomes are strongly influenced by **BMI, lifestyle, and diet**.  
- **Gestational diabetes and high fat levels** significantly increase risks for both mother and baby.  
- **Healthy diets** are linked with better hemoglobin levels and higher full-term births.  
- **Lifestyle risks (smoking, alcohol, drugs)** affect pregnancy outcomes, particularly in younger women.  
- **Newborn health** is impacted by maternal BMI and delivery mode, with C-sections linked to higher complications.  

This project highlights the importance of **preventive care, healthy diet, and monitoring maternal fat & BMI** during pregnancy.
